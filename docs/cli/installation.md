# CLI Installation
------------------

The CLI is [written in Golang](https://github.com/fgrehm/devstep-cli) and precompiled
binaries are available for each GitHub tagged release. Installing it is a matter
of downloading it from GitHub, placing the binary on a directory available on your
`PATH` and making it executable.

This one liner can handle it for you assuming that `$HOME/bin` is available
on your `PATH`:

```sh
L=$HOME/bin/devstep && curl -sL https://github.com/fgrehm/devstep-cli/releases/download/v1.0.0/linux_amd64 > $L && chmod +x $L
```

Please note that the CLI is currently limited to connecting to a local `/var/run/docker.sock`
socket only and the user that runs `devstep` commands will need [non-root access to it](http://docs.docker.io/installation/ubuntulinux/#giving-non-root-access).
Support for execution over TCP is likely to be added at some point.


> **IMPORTANT**: A `developer` user will be used by Devstep and it assumes your
user and group ids are equal to `1000` when using the CLI or the container's init
process will be aborted. This is to guarantee that files created within Docker
containers have the appropriate permissions so that you can manipulate them
on the host without the need to use `sudo`. This is currently a Devstep limitation
that will be worked around in case there is enough demand or will be fixed once
Docker adds support for user namespaces.

> The `1000` id was chosen because it is the default uid / gid of Ubuntu Desktop users
that are created during the installation process. To work around this limitation
you can build your own image with the appropriate ids and add a `source_image: '<YOUR-IMAGE>:<OPTIONAL-TAG>'`
line to your `~/devstep.yml` so that the image is used as a source for your projects.

## Bash autocomplete

An autocompletion script can be installed using the one liner below:

```sh
curl -sL https://github.com/codegangsta/cli/raw/master/autocomplete/bash_autocomplete | sed 's/$PROG/devstep/' | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/devstep
```
